This repository is a list of gamedev/graphics/science RSS feeds I've collected over the years, grouped in categories in the OPML format for [feedly](https://feedly.com), a great news aggregator that allows me to keep up to date with all the great content out there.

Feel free to suggest additional RSS feeds that are worth following!
